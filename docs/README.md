# Introduction

**Frontend development** has taken the world by storm in the last decade with extreme progress in all web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) sponsored and led by the biggest software companies in the world. It is arguably one of the highest paid, the most in-demand and satisfying jobs in the software industry for quite some time. This is the best time to learn it if you haven’t started already!

Here is an exhaustive list and brief overview of the front-end technologies (languages, libraries/frameworks and software), concepts, and online resources one can learn to become a great front-end developer in 2020. The objective of this manual is to become a single point of reference for modern frontend development.

### Technologies

#### The Internet and The World Wide Web (WWW)

![Internet logo](https://img.icons8.com/color/60/000000/internet.png "Internet")
![World Wide Web logo](https://img.icons8.com/fluent/60/000000/domain.png "World Wide Web")

The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

The Web, also referred formally as World Wide Web (www) is collection of information which is accessed via the Internet. Another way to look at this difference is; the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is service on top of that infrastructure. Alternatively, the Internet can be viewed as a big book-store while the Web can be viewed as collection of books on that store. At a high level, we can even think of the Internet as hardware and the Web as software.

#### W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)

![W3C logo](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/60/000000/w3c.png "W3C")

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 21 October 2019, W3C had 443 members. W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.

The W3C mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web. These are the important aspects of their [mission](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission).

#### WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)

<img src="https://api.iconify.design/logos:whatwg.svg" alt="WHATWG logo" title="WHATWG" height="60" width="60" />

The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) is a community of people interested in evolving the web through standards and tests.

The WHATWG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in 2004, after a W3C workshop. Apple, Mozilla and Opera were becoming increasingly concerned about the W3C’s direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML, and apparent disregard for the needs of real-world web developers. So, in response, these organisations set out with a mission to address these concerns and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group was born.

In 2017, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla helped develop an IPR policy and governance structure for the WHATWG, together forming a Steering Group to oversee relevant policies.

#### Ecma International and ES (ECMAScript)

Ecma is a standards organization for information and communication systems. The organization was founded in 1961 to standardize computer systems in Europe. Ecma aims to develop standards and technical reports to facilitate and standardize the use of information communication technology and consumer electronics; encourage the correct use of standards by influencing the environment in which they are applied; and publish these standards and reports in electronic and printed form. Ecma publications, including standards, can be freely copied by all interested parties without copyright restrictions. The development of standards and technical reports is done in co-operation with the appropriate national, European and international organisations.

ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js and Deno.

#### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

![HTML logo](https://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/60/000000/html.png "HTML")

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as `<head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>` and many others.

An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the `<title>` tag can be written as `<Title>, <TITLE>,` or in any other way.

##### HTML5

![Html5 logo](https://img.icons8.com/color/60/000000/html-5.png "HTML5")

HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.

All HTML5 technologies are classified into several groups based on their function.

-   _Semantics:_ allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.
-   _Connectivity:_ allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.
-   _Offline and storage:_ allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently.
-   _Multimedia:_ making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.
-   _2D/3D graphics and effects:_ allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.
-   _Performance and integration:_ providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.
-   _Device access:_ allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.
-   _Styling:_ letting authors write more sophisticated themes.

#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

![CSS logo](https://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/60/000000/css.png "CSS")

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized across Web browsers according to the W3C specification. Previously development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchroniously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendation. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.

From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations seperately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of CSS specification.

##### CSS3

![CSS3 logo](https://img.icons8.com/color/60/000000/css3.png "CSS3")

CSS3 is the latest evolution of the [Cascading Style Sheets](#css-cascading-style-sheets) language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like [rounded corners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius), [shadows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), [gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients), [transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) or [animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation), as well as new layouts like [multi-columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts), [flexible box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) or [grid layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.

CSS Level 2 needed 9 years, from August 2002 to June 2011 to reach the Recommendation status. This was due to the fact that a few secondary features held back the whole specification. In order to accelerate the standardization of non-problematic features, the [CSS Working Group](#csswg-css-working-group) of the W3C, in a decision referred as the [Beijing doctrine](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/modules), divided CSS in smaller components called modules. Each of these modules is now an independent part of the language and moves towards standardization at its own pace. While some modules are already W3C Recommendations, other still are early Working Drafts.

###### Completed modules

A few CSS modules already became a standard as a W3C Recommendation. There should be no more changes.

-   [**CSS Color Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-3/) `Recommendation since June 7th, 2011`

-   [**CSS Namespaces Module**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-namespaces-3/) `Recommendation since September 29th, 2011`

-   [**Selectors Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-3/) `Recommendation since September 29th, 2011`

-   [**Media Queries**](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-3/) `Recommendation since June 19th, 2012`

-   [**CSS Style Attributes**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-style-attr/) `Recommendation since November 7th, 2013`

-   [**CSS Fonts Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/) `Candidate Recommendation since September 20th, 2018`

-   [**CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-3/) `Recommendation since June 21st, 2018`

###### Stable modules

A few CSS modules are already fairly stable and have reached one of the three recommendation level of the CSSWG: `Candidate Recommendation`, `Proposed Recommendation` or `Recommendation`. These can be used without prefix and are pretty stable, though a few features can still be dropped at the Candidate Recommendation stage.

These modules extend and amend the CSS2.1 specification which build the core of the specification. Together with it, they are the current snapshot of the CSS specification.

-   [**CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/) `Candidate Recommendation`

-   [**CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-3/) `Candidate Recommendation`

-   [**CSS Multi-column Layout Module**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-1/) `Working Draft`

-   [**CSS Values and Units Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-3/) `Candidate Recommendation`

-   [**CSS Flexible Box Layout Module**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/) `Candidate Recommendation`

-   [**CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-3/) `Candidate Recommendation`

-   [**CSS Writing Modes Module Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/) `Proposed Recommendation`

-   [**CSS Counter Styles Level 3**](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-counter-styles-3/) `Candidate Recommendation`

#### JS (JavaScript)

![JavaScript logo](https://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/60/000000/js.png "JavaScript")

JavaScript (often shortened as JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or [Just-In-Time compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) language with [first-class functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function) support. Even though it is primarily used as the scripting language for the web platform, .i.e, the browser environment, many non-browser environments such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) and [Adobe Acrobat](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html) use it as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded dynamic language that supports imperative, object-oriented and declarative (functional programming) styles.

The standard for JavaScript is [ECMAScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources). As of 2012, all modern browsers supported ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers supported atleast ECMAScript 3. On June 17 2015, ECMAScript International released the sixth major version of ECMAScript which was initially referred as ECMAScript2015 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript is on an yearly release cycle. The current released standard version is ECMAScript 2020 or ES11.

JavaScript runs on the client side of the web which is responsible for controlling web page behaviour on occurrence of an event. It is easy to learn and powerful enough to create interactive web applications.

Contrary to popular misconception, **JavaScript is not interpreted Java**. Apart from having the first four same characters and registered trademarks assigned to Oracle in the US, they are different programming languages with different use-cases. JavaScript is a loosely typed language that supports prototypial (object-oriented) inheritance whereas Java is a strongly typed language that supports classical inheritance. Objects can be created at run time in JavaScript as compared to the classical syntax that has to be created at build time by compiled languages such as C++ or Java.

The dynamic capabilities of JavaScript includes run-time object construction, variable-parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (by `eval`), object introspection via (for..in loop) and source code recovery (JS programs can decompile their function bodies to their original source text).

##### JavaScript Engines

There are six major JavaScript engines released and used by the world's biggest tech companies to date.

-   **SpiderMonkey and Rhino - Mozilla (Netscape)**

    -   SpiderMonkey was written by Brendan Eich in C/C++. Rhino was primarily written by Norris Boyd in Java. Both engines were optimized to be compliant with ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions. Some major engine runtime optimizations such as TracerMonkey (Firefox 3.5), JagerMonkey (Firefox 4) and IonMonkey were added to SpiderMonkey engine respectively. Code performance optimizations are constantly added to improve the engine.

-   **V8 - Google**
    <img src="https://api.iconify.design/logos:v8.svg" alt="V8 logo" title="V8" height="48" width="48" />

    -   V8 is the high-performance JS engine used in leading software and technologies such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (latest version), Opera (version 15+) and NodeJS.

-   **JavaScriptCore (SquirrelFish/Nitro) - Apple**

    -   JavaScriptCore is used by some of the Webkit browsers such as Apple Safari.

-   **Carakan - Opera (version < 15)**

    -   This engine was used in the older version of the Opera browser before the company adopted Google's V8 engine and deprecated its own.

-   **Chakra - Microsoft**
    -   This engine was used in the Internet Explorer and older version of Microsoft Edge browsers before the company adopted Google's V8 engine and deprecated its own.

#### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

<img src="https://api.iconify.design/logos:json.svg" alt="JSON logo" title="JSON" height="60" width="60" />

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the [JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ecma-st/ECMA-262.pdf). JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

JSON is built on two structures:

-   A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
-   An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.
